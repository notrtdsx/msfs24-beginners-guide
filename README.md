# MSFS 2024 Beginner's Guide

A no-nonsense, practical guide for learning Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 with an Xbox controller.

## What's This?

This is a comprehensive web-based guide that actually helps you get started with MSFS 2024 without feeling overwhelmed. If you've ever loaded up the sim, stared at the cockpit, and thought "what the hell do I do now?" - this guide is for you.

## Features

- **Controller setup that actually works** - Sensitivity settings that won't make your plane flip out
- **Plain English explanations** - No aviation PhD required
- **Step-by-step walkthroughs** - Takeoff, landing, and everything in between
- **Career mode guide** - Make some money and unlock cool stuff
- **Common mistakes** - Learn from my crashes so you don't have to make them
- **Dark mode** - Because who flies at 2am with bright mode on?
- **Mobile friendly** - Read on your phone while you're stuck on a loading screen

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up your Xbox controller so it doesn't suck
- Which planes to start with (and which ones to avoid)
- Basic flight controls without the complicated theory
- How to take off and land without dying
- VFR navigation (flying by looking out the window)
- Career mode missions and progression
- Emergency procedures for when things go wrong
- Radio communications and ATC basics
- Weather settings and what they actually mean
- Autopilot so you can grab a snack mid-flight

## Features That Don't Suck

- **Interactive checklist** - Tracks your progress as you learn
- **Search function** - Find what you need quickly
- **Sticky navigation** - Always know where you are
- **Collapsible sections** - Information when you need it
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Press 'T' to toggle theme
- **Print friendly** - Take it with you (if you're into paper)
- **Progress bar** - See how far you've scrolled

## Why I Made This

Because every other guide either assumes you already know how to fly, or it's 47 pages of theory before you ever touch a control. I just wanted something that gets you in the air and actually having fun.

## Tips for Using This Guide

- Don't try to learn everything at once
- Start with assists ON - there's no shame in it
- Practice one thing at a time
- The checklist at the end is your friend
- Bookmark sections you need to reference often
- Use the search button if you're looking for something specific

## What This Isn't

- Not a comprehensive flight training manual
- Not for real-world aviation (please don't use this to fly actual planes)
- Not trying to make you an expert overnight
- Not full of unnecessary screenshots that bloat the page
